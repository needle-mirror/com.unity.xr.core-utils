    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added the [Building Blocks system](xref:xr-core-utils-building-blocks), an overlay window in the scene view with quick access to commonly used items in the project.\n- Added the [Capability Profile system](xref:xr-core-utils-capability-profile) that allows the creation of assets with key-value pairs to abstract the capabilities of a platform, device, OS, or a combination of them.\n- Added `EditorAnalyticsEvent` class that can be extended to create editor analytics events. This class supports the new analytics APIs introduced in editor version 2023.2 as well as the analytics APIs from older editor versions.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed Project Validation to query `IsRuleEnabled` and `CheckPredicate` before invoking `FixIt` action of a `BuildValidationRule` via **Fix All** button. This prevents `FixIt` action being called unexpectedly via **Fix All** button while the changes by another rule are in progress.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the sort order of enabled issues in the Project Validation window to keep them in the original order added in code.\n- Fixed to prevent the progress bar from getting stuck when an exception is thrown during the `BuildValidationRule.FixIt` method.\n- Fixed a bug in `ScriptableSettingsBase` that would attempt to create a new instance of the settings asset even when the asset already existed.\n- Fixed an issue in the Project Validation window where opening a Unity project without window focus could throw an exception."
